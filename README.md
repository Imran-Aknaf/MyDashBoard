# MyDashboard

This is a personal time-blocking app I'm building from scratch using fundamental HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Current progress

- Step #1: Created a vertical day timeline from 00:00 to 24:00.

## Next steps / TODO

- Align hour labels precisely to face the boundary between hour blocks (instead of centered)
- Add ability to create and drag activity blocks inside the timeline
- Save user activities locally (localStorage or backend)
- Add time indicators (current time)
